## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some of this was actually quite challenging due to it being slightly longer than previous exercises, however managed in the end. I took more time planning my HTML, ensuring each section was wrapped in a container for an easier time putting the layout together. Especially happy with my use of flexbox for the table at the bottom. I know I could have used a table element here, however I seen this as an opportunity to practice my flexbox skills. ðŸ˜Ž
